This A/B testing analysis shows that both promotional strategies: 25% Discount and Free Shipping. Both performed almost equally in terms of reach and conversions. The 25% Discount achieved 16,493 views, a 9.79% conversion rate, and a slightly higher average order value of 402.23, while Free Shipping recorded 16,119 views, a 9.86% conversion rate, and an average order value of 400.25, though with more fluctuation over time. This indicates that discounts may encourage customers to spend a bit more per order, while free shipping remains an attractive driver of conversions. Going forward, a blended approach could be more effective , offering discounts to lift order value and free shipping with minimum thresholds to balance profitability and customer appeal.
